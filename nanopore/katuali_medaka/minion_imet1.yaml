# Master katuali configuration file template
# ------------------------------------------
#
# Having copied this file with the command:
#     katuali_config my_config.yaml
# it will be necessary to amend the `DATA:` dictionary in the first section below
# to define the dataset to be processed.
#
# The second section containing software locations should also be checked and
# amended if necessary.
#
# To run the predefined workflows: fast_assm_polish standard_assm_polish
# standard_assm_nanopolish all_medaka_train_features starting from fast5 input,
# nothing else need be done. If starting a workflow from basecall data
# (https://nanoporetech.github.io/katuali/examples.html#starting-from-existing-basecalls),
# basecalls should be placed under a folder as determined by the value of the
# `BASECALLER` in the pipeline options.


####################
# Input data options

# .fast5 files can be under top-level folders named by a RUNID (these need not
# be actual run UUIDs). Fast5s should be in RUNID/reads.  The keys within this
# data dictionary are RUNIDs.
#
# REFERENCE is required for the medaka training workflows, and in general any
# time reads need to be aligned to a reference (e.g. for for subsampling)
# and for calling variants. 
#   
# MEDAKA_TRAIN_REGIONS and MEDAKA_EVAL_REGIONS define regions for
# training and evaluation within the medaka training workflow, and are
# otherwise not used. 
#
# MEDAKA_VARIANT_REGIONS is used in the medaka_all_variant workflow. 
#
# GENOME_SIZE is required only in workflows using the canu assembler.
#
# In the example below we train from the "minion" run using "ecoli" and "yeast"
# contigs in the reference and evaluate on the "gridion" run using the contigs
# "ecoli", "yeast" and "na12878_chr21" in the reference.

# Location of various software
#
# Configuration for software is found toward the end of this config.

# Katuali supports running medaka consensus only on CPU and training only on
# GPU. If you wish to train and run consensus it is easiest to create two
# medaka virtual environemnts - one for GPU (with tensorflow-gpu installed) and
# one for CPU (with just tensorflow installed). 
IN_MEDAKA: "/opt/medaka/bin/activate"  # medaka used for consensus - should only have tensorflow installed
IN_MEDAKA_GPU: "~/git/medaka_gpu/venv/bin/activate"  # medaka used for training - should have tensorflow-gpu installed

# Pipeline options

# Basecaller for predefined workflows. The `fast_assm_polish`,
# `standard_assm_polish` `standard_assm_nanopolish` and medaka training
# workflows use this value to determine the basecaller setup to use.

#########################
# Compute/cluster options

# Location of scratch space on cluster nodes. This is currently only used for
# medaka training where latency on an networked filesystem can significantly
# slow things down. To have katuali copy medaka features to scratch space
# before training set SCRATCH and optionally TMPSCRATCH.
#
# If TMPSCRATCH is given the resultant path will be:
#     /SCRATCH/$USER/TMPSCRATCH
# whereas if it is not given the resultant path will be:
#    /SCRATCH/$USER/<generated unique name>
#
# TMPSCRATCH is useful in the case of restarting a training job on a node to
# which features have already been copied; in this case, simply set TMPSCRATCH
# to the directory under which the features were copied and katuali will skip
# copying the data and use the existing data.
#
# Note that katuali does not delete the data in scratch, so users must do this
# manually.
